        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <h3>IT Support</h3>
        <p>As an IT Support professional, I have a solid understanding of troubleshooting, hardware, software, and network-related issues. I was also fortunate enough to participate in projects like - site migration, wi-fi upgrade, printer roll out and phone system upgrade. I enjoy helping people and organizations keep their tech running smoothly, whether it's through on-site support or remote assistance.</p>

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>
            I hold a bachelor’s degree in information and communication technology, which provided me with a strong foundation in web development. During my second year, I worked on a project where I built a fully functional website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This included developing key features such as user registration, login functionality, and log creation, with all data stored in a database. The hands-on experience I gained during this project not only enhanced my front-end skills but also provided me with an understanding of how to integrate front-end and back-end technologies.
            Following my graduation, I worked as a Back-End Developer, where I wrote Django and Django REST APIs using Python, Docker, and Git. While this role focused primarily on back-end development, I also gained exposure to front-end technologies. These skills were essential in ensuring smooth communication between the back-end and the-front end of the application. In addition, I became familiar with the importance of version control using Git for efficient collaboration in team environments
        </p>

        <h3>Admin</h3>
        <p>
            In my current role, I consistently demonstrate my ability to plan and prioritise effectively by starting each day with a clear focus on my tasks. I prioritize tasks based on their level of importance, distinguishing between corporate-level, business operation-level, departmental, and individual responsibilities. This approach ensures that I am always working on the most critical tasks that align with the business's needs and objectives.
            I take a proactive approach to my work, often taking the initiative to start tasks without needing instructions from my manager. This initiative allows me to stay ahead of deadlines and contribute positively to the team’s overall productivity. Once I complete a task, I make sure to report back to my manager for feedback or suggestions. I view this as an opportunity to improve and refine my work to meet the team's standards.
        </p>

        <h3>Hip-Hop Dance Teacher</h3>
        <p>When I’m not working with tech, I’m on the dance floor! I’ve been practicing hip-hop dance for several years and love the creativity and energy it brings. Performing and expressing myself through movement has been an incredibly rewarding experience.</p>
